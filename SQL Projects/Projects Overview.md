SQL Functions and Concepts Used:
   - Window Functions: Used to analyze data across different rows that are related to the current row, allowing for comparisons across partitions of data (e.g., sales trends over time).
   - FIRST_VALUE(): This function was used to retrieve the first value in an ordered set of data, helping in identifying the first sale or top-performing product within a specific    partition.
   - (CTE): CTEs were utilized to simplify complex queries by breaking them into reusable components, making the overall query structure cleaner and easier to read.
   - ROW_NUMBER(): This function was used to assign a unique number to each row within a partition, useful for ranking sales by performance, such as determining the top-performing products or regions.
   - SUM() and COUNT(): These aggregate functions were used to calculate total sales and count the number of transactions, respectively, often in conjunction with GROUP BY for grouping data by specific attributes like region or product category.
   - GROUP BY: This clause was used in conjunction with aggregate functions to group data based on certain columns, enabling the analysis of sales by regions, products, or time periods.
   - HAVING: Applied after GROUP BY to filter aggregated results, ensuring that only relevant data (e.g., sales over a certain threshold) was considered.
   - DISTINCT: This was used to eliminate duplicate records, ensuring the accuracy and uniqueness of the data, especially when analyzing customer information.
   - UPDATE and DELETE: These operations were used to correct invalid data or remove duplicates from the dataset, ensuring the integrity and cleanliness of the data.
   - Date Functions (YEAR(), DATE_FORMAT()): These were employed to extract and format date-related information, helping in temporal analysis such as revenue trends across months or years.
